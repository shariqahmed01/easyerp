            <p>Cyboard is a 100 % online school which ensures that learners can access it on their devices from anywhere and don’t have to go physically and attend classes. The moment they log in, they are inside the school. At Cyboard school, we offer the
                best of all worlds: stress free, systematic and structured virtual classes from the comfort and safety of your own home. Now anyone from everywhere can learn from our best trained teachers & curriculums which are not otherwise approachable
                because of the distance from the school, non-availability of good teachers for all subjects in traditional school, absence of a good school in the city/town, or because of exorbitant fee structures. All you need is a computer or a smart
                phone and an internet connection to have best education at your doorsteps.</p>

            <p>With an option to study from smart books and traditional books, AOL School makes learning a fun affair. The curriculum is covered with interactive activities such as group quizzes on alternate days to boost the collaborative capabilities of
                our students. AOL School ensures your child is taught only by the best minds. And that’s why our Grade 6-12 classes are designed by IITians. Besides, with regular attendance and activity reports, and monthly PTM meetings, you will always
                be in control of your child’s progress.</p>
